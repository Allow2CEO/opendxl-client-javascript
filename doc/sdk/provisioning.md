In order for a client to connect to the DXL fabric, it must be provisioned.

A provisioned client includes certificate information required to establish an
authenticated connection to the fabric as well as information regarding the
brokers to connect to.

For more information on provisioning, see the
[Python SDK documentation](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/provisioningoverview.html).

  > **Note:** The OpenDXL JavaScript Client (Node.js) does not yet have support
  > for provisioning via the Command Line Interface (CLI) like the
  > [Python client](https://opendxl.github.io/opendxl-client-python/pydoc/basiccliprovisioning.html#basiccliprovisioning)
  > does.
